- I don't like that completions (from Completions), for files and folders, lists all path and not only names.
  For example given the files:
  /usr/bin/one.txt
  /usr/bin/two.txt

  if I do completion for /usr/bin/ I get:
  /usr/bin/one.txt
  /usr/bin/two.txt

  but I want:
  one.txt
  two.txt

  But pay attention: the commands expect the full path.

- VirtualCommandArgument.complete must return an information to know if there is one precise match.
  For example if the argument is a file then it's an existent file, in that case and if there are more
  mandatory arguments, then I add a space to the result, so the user can digit the next arg.
- completions: if the proposals start with a common prefix longer than the argument of the user,
  replace the argument with that prefix.
  For example if I have the files:
  warehouse1
  warehouse2

  and I digit "cat ware" then tab, the command line must be "cd warehouse".
- use shapeless to make a type safe parser for command's arguments (look at TestingShapeless)
  there's a problem I think with Intellij, look at TODO
- ls accept a folder || file pattern

DONE
-----
- use VirtualCommandArguments in LsCommand
- use VirtualCommandArguments in CatCommand
- implement completion for FileArgument and FolderArgument
- use VirtualCommandArguments in CdCommand
